**2. About the Vitago Platform**

Vitago is a digital platform that connects individuals in need of household services with independent service providers. The platform serves as a marketplace where customers can find, book, and review providers of services such as:
- Cleaning
- Window washing
- Other related services

Vitago provides a technical solution to facilitate communication and payments between the parties, but is not involved in the execution of services.
